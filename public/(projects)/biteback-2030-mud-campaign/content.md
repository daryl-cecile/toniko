# BiteBack 2030 - Müd Campaign

**Problem:** 
Big brands are profiting off misleading health claims, leading the general public to buy food that they believe is much more healthy & balanced than it actually is.

**Solution:**
I came up with the concept to create a [fake brand called Müd](https://www.instagram.com/the_mudbar/). Using the big brands' own tactics, to highlight how easy it is to be misled. Launching a fake social media page as well as fake products. Interviewing the public if they would buy MÜD. All building up to the grand reveal that the nutritious snack bar was all but well packaged mud!


**Impact:**
