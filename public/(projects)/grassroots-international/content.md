**Problem:** 40 years have passed sinced the founding days of Grassroots International. They wanted to celebrate as well as raise awareness for their work in a campaign video. 

**Solution:** We created a anniversary video that uses elements of spoken word and motion graphics to tell the journey of Grassroots throughout the years. 

**Impact:** The client CEO shed tears of joy upon seeing the video. It will be used as their flagship video across their whole brand and used in pitching efforts.
