**Problem:** 
In the face of the Ukraine War, many refugees fleeing from home are looking for work in foreign countries where their expertise are wasted and where they are not given a chance to thrive. Women are disproportionally affected.

**Solution:**
I concepted and scripted and directed this  animation using Ukrainian artists to shed light on true life experiences of Ukraine women looking for work. All with the hope to rally employers to work with Tent for Refugees to offer support to these women. 

**Impact:**
Screened in Trafalgar Square as part of the Ukraine Vigil marking one year. It has gone on to be played as a pitch video to big institutions and embassies in Europe to support refugees from Ukraine find work.

This animation picked up press in numerous [publications like LBB](https://www.lbbonline.com/news/stories-of-ukrainian-women-inspire-powerful-animation-urging-business-leaders-to-hire-refugees)
